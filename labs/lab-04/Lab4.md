### Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?

Without a license, our code is not technically open source. When a new project is created without licensing it properly, other developers will not be able to (legally) include that codebase in their own projects due to an implicit ownership by the creator. When wee add a license, we lay out the rules for using our code, making it legal for other developers to include it in their projects as long as they follow the guidelines laid out in our license.



### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license

 Just because a project's source code is freely available does not technically mean that it can legally be used elsewhere. In fact, without an explicit license, the original creator does technically have the right to sue a developer for using their code, even if that code is open source.



### Do you agree with the claim laid out in Why the Web beat Gopher?

In this writeup, the authors argue that modern web standards were chosen over the original standards laid out by Gopher because they were more developer friendly. For example, these standards were made public and introduced to the broader developer community very early in the development process so that community feedback could be taken into account and potential users could start to understand the technology before it was ready for use. To make matters worse, Gopher chose to distinguish between educational and commercial users, and opted to charge a fee for any commercial entities hoping to use their service. While the authors do lay out a compelling argument, I don't believe that these two factors alone are enough to dictate the success of one standard/project over another. For example, Windows and MacOS are both proprietary operating systems which have made countless anti-developer choices in the past, yet many programmers chose to use these operating systems over linux due to their simplicity and ease of use.



### Project Licensing Justification

Since linux was built by the open source community as an alternative to existing proprietary kernels, it makes sense for them to choose one of the most aggressive licenses they could to ensure that it would never be used in the sorts of closed source projects they were trying to fight against. Due to the rules laid out in the GPL (which the linux kernel is licensed under), a project like the Android kernel **must** also be licensed under the GPL as well, since it is built off of the linux kernel.
